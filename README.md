# Anime Viewership Analysis

**Status**: In progress

Welcome to the Anime Viewership Analysis project! This repository houses all the code and documentation for my data science project aimed at alleviating user decision fatigue and providing predictive insights to anime studios.

## Project Overview

**Problem Statement:** As anime fans face an overwhelming array of choices, the dual challenges of easing decision fatigue and providing studios with data-driven insights into potential viewership ratings are more prominent than ever.

**Solution:** This project introduces a dual-purpose recommendation system utilizing XGBoost and Cosine Similarity models. These models not only tailor recommendations to enhance user experience but also help studios forecast potential ratings for upcoming productions.

## Repository Contents

- `data/` - Contains the datasets used, including user ratings and detailed anime statistics.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks illustrating the exploratory data analysis and modeling steps.
- `docs/` - Additional documentation and project report.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** for all programming needs.
- **Pandas** and **NumPy** for data manipulation.
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning modeling.
- **XGBoost** for building the predictive model.
- **Cosine Similarity** for the recommendation system.
